# WorldCup2023_Data_Analysis_WebScraping_Python_PowerBi
This project is dedicated to curating the optimal 11-player lineup from the teams participating in the World Cup 2023. I've harnessed my data analysis expertise using Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and Selenium. These tools were instrumental in scraping comprehensive data from ESPN's website, covering World Cup 2023 match statistics, batting and bowling metrics, and player details.

I have used Google collab to scrap the Match_tables, batting and bowling data. While using Google collab to scrap the data of 151 players and using selenium scrap the image of players, the code getting crashed. I used Pycharm to scrap the players data due to this reason. Image_link is loaded dynamically, so I considered using Selenium.

Python served as the primary tool for data analysis, allowing for meticulous examination and manipulation of the collected data. Additionally, I've utilized Power BI for insightful visualization, empowering a deeper exploration of player performances and statistical trends.

The project's core objective revolves around evaluating specific criteria and metrics to discern the best-performing 11 players among the World Cup 2023 participants. This repository encapsulates a detailed and systematic approach to data analysis, showcasing the utilization of Python for comprehensive data examination and the subsequent identification and presentation of the top-performing players.
